# Database Deployment

- Open the database project located in the folder 
"{RepoCloneDir} \solution\Database\ADSGoFastDatabase\ADSGoFastDatabase.sln". This is a Visual Studio Data Tools project file and will require Visual Studio data tools to be installed on your machine. 
- Deploy the database project to the new Azure SQL Server instance that has been created in your sandbox environment by the deployment process. 
- Run the Post Deployment scripts located at \solution\Database\ADSGoFastDatabase\ADSGoFastDatabase\Scripts\. Your newly created database should be the target for these scripts.
