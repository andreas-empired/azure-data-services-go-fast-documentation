- On your local development machine navigate to the folder shown below:
``` fs_name
{RepoCloneDir}\solution\DataFactory
```
- Copy the contents from the directory above into the new Git repository that you have linked to your Azure Datafactory. 
- Navigate to [Azure Data Factory Studio](https://adf.azure.com/).
- If required select the new data factory that was created during the ARM deployment in the previous steps. 
- Update the "KeyVault" Linked Service so that it points to the Key Vault service endpoint that was created during your ARM script deployment.
