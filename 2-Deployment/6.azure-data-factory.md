- In the Azure portal navigate to the Azure Data Factory instance that was created during the ARM template deployment process. 
- Connect a Git Repository to this Azure Data Factory. [Click here for details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/source-control)
- Once you have set-up your Azure Data Factory Git repository copy the contents from "{RepoCloneDir}\solution\DataFactory" into the new repository.
- Navigate to [Azure Data Factory Studio](https://adf.azure.com/).
- If required select the new data factory that was created during the ARM deployment in the previous steps. 
- Update the "KeyVault" Linked Service so that it points to the Key Vault service endpoint that was created during your ARM script deployment.
