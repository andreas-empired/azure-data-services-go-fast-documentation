# Web Application Deployment

* On your local develelopment machine navigate to the directory shown below:
``` fs_name
{RepoCloneDir}\solution\WebApplication\
```
* Find the file in that directory called "WebApplication.sln" and open it using Visual Studio
* Restore Nuget Packages
* Restore Libman packages
* Publish the application to the App Service Plan created during deployment
* Once published you will need to set the Web Application settings using Kudu. Use the **App Settings Template** provided below to create the appropriate settings. Note, you may not have some of the required information yet as some of it is created later in the deployment and configuration process. If you don't know what to fill out just leave a placeholder value there for now.  
* For local development and testing create an "AppSettings.json" file in the solution using the **App Settings Template** template. Note, **create the template file as it is below and do NOT modify it**. Next, go to the solution explorer and right click on the project file. Select "Manage User Secrets" from the context menu and paste another version of the template into the Secrets.json file that opens. Update your sensitive information in the secrets.json file. Note that you may not have some of the required information yet as some of it is created later in the deployment and configuration process. If you don't know what to fill out just leave a placeholder value there for now.
